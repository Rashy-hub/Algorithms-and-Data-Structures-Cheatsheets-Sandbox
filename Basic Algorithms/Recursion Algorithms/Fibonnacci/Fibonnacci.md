# Fibonacci Algorithm: A Theoretical Overview

## Introduction

The **Fibonacci sequence** is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. This sequence is named after the Italian mathematician **Leonardo of Pisa**, known as Fibonacci.

For example, the beginning of the Fibonacci sequence is:

-   `0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...`

## Definition

The Fibonacci sequence is defined recursively as follows:

-   **F(0) = 0**
-   **F(1) = 1**
-   **F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)** for `n > 1`

This recursive definition highlights the relationship between the Fibonacci numbers and forms the basis for various algorithmic implementations.

## Common Use Cases

Fibonacci numbers are used in various fields, including:

-   **Computer Science**: In algorithms related to sorting, searching, and dynamic programming.
-   **Mathematics**: To study sequences, series, and number theory.
-   **Biology**: To describe phenomena such as the branching of trees, the arrangement of leaves, or the flowering of artichokes.
-   **Finance**: In technical analysis, Fibonacci retracement levels are used to predict stock price movements.

## Algorithmic Implementations

There are several ways to compute Fibonacci numbers, including:

-   **Iterative Approach**: A simple method that uses loops to compute Fibonacci numbers.
-   **Naive Recursion**: A straightforward but inefficient approach due to overlapping subproblems.
-   **Memoized Recursion**: Using memoization or tabulation to store previously computed values, improving efficiency.
